## Introduction

The Minecraft Server Administration Guide (MSAG) is a guide intended for people who wish to administer a Minecraft server, while utilising the best practices I have accumulated over the years.

I have decided to write this book since I have stopped being interested with Minecraft and wish to share my knowledge.

## Conventions

- Be operating system independent.
- Date format used shall be the standard (YYYY/MM/DD).
- The guide will aim to be as operation system independent as possible.
- Gender neutral pronouns shall be used.
