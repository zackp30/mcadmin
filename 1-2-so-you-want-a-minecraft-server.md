So, you want a Minecraft server.

For that you need a few things:

- A computer with (at least) 1.5GB of RAM (can be less if you use an operating system other than Windows, i.e: GNU/Linux).
- A Java runtime of at least version 1.6 (either the OpenJDK JRE, or the Oracle JRE). See [this section](#java-installation) for more details.
